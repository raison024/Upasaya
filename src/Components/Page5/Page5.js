                    After 13 years of R&D and experience in Ayurveda and Naturopathy, we opened up an exclusive retreat focusing on holistic healing of Diabetes. 
                    At our retreat, we use age-old methods of Ayurveda, yoga with a combination modern nutrition and dietetics in compliance with the new age tech, which helps us monitor real time glucose levels and our nutritionists will keep an eye on how each and every body is reacting to different kinds of food using the tech. According to this we personalise menus.
